# NumPy-Base-for-all-numerical-and-computation-process-in-Python
If you're new to programming, you probably don't realize how complex and powerful arrays are. In this post, we'll look at how to use them in Python. We'll cover the different methods of creating arrays, indexing into them, slicing them along various axes, reshaping them so they can be used as lists (and vice versa) and more! This article is intended to provide the user with a basic understanding of the NumPy library, and to give them some knowledge of the underlying mathematics in Python. It will also show how easy it is to implement some of these algorithms in Python.
